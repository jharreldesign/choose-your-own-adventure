CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE GAME: Magic The Gathering

Friday Night Magic


Intro: Man, Friday again? Lets get to the game store but first we must choose what deck we will play tonight! Choose your color combo:
            Rakdos (Black/Red), Boros (Red/White), Golgari (Black/Green) or Dimir (Black/Blue).

Rakdos: Nice, Rakdos! Your Plainswalker for tonight is this card. Now let's get out of the house. Will you take the bus or walk to the game store?

Bus: You grab a seat on the bus. However, someone has decided to steal your stuff!
